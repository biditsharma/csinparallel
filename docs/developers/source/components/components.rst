Title
*****

Unless you started with this page, you've had to enter a title for your module in several places. If you did start here, check out the list of existing modules to see what kinds of titles they tend to have (and to make sure you're not duplicating an existing one!).

Summary
*******

Used on the website, this is a short description of the content, language, objectives, and length of your module. See the list of modules on the website for examples.

Context for Use
***************

Where would you teach this module? Consider the following: what course or level? with what other topics? in what kind of setting (lab, classroom, independent reading)? what technology and background knowledge would students need? 

Learning objectives
*******************

What do you want students to *know* and *be able to do* by the end of each lesson and after completing the module? How will you *assess* whether they've gained these competencies?

With those things in mind, write objectives with **active, measurable** language. For example, rather than *Students will be more knowledgeable about race conditions,* here are some more useful alternatives:
	- Students will **identify** race conditions in provided code.
	- Students will orally **define** and **give an example** of a race condition to a classmate.
	- Students will **describe** (and/or **implement**) a safer alternative to code containing potential race conditions.

The level of proficiency you expect of students is at your discretion, given their expertise and time constraints. Measurable doesn't necessarily have to mean a lengthier or more involved project: `here`_ is a list of action verbs for each stage of `Bloom's Taxonomy`_.

Create module content
*********************

For the actual .rst files, see the template section. How exactly you format your content depends on who you envision the audience being: are you creating material students would interact with directly, or that instructors would absorb and teach from?


Write teaching notes and tips
*****************************

Anticipated sticky spots for students or things that took longer than you might think? Useful things to know about the software involved? Metaphors you've successfully used to explain the content? Jot it all down - the less other instructors have to try to read your mind or reinvent the wheel, the more everyone benefits.

Create supporting exercises
