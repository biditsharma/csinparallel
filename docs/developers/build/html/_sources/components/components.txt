Components of a Module
**********************

Sphinx, check. Github, check. CSS, check. Now...what actually goes in a module? Here are descriptions of the various sections, organized by what's expected of developers, what gets done by CSinParallel, and what could go either way or be shared.

Author's Responsibilities
#########################

Title
*****

Unless you started with this page, you've had to enter a title for your module in several places. If you *did* start here, check out the list of existing modules to see what kinds of titles they tend to have (and to make sure you're not duplicating an existing one!). It should be descriptive but not too long.

Summary
*******

Used on the website, this is a short (1-3 sentence) description of the content, language, objectives, and length of your module. See the list of modules on the website for examples.

Context for Use
***************

In what course(s) have you used or would you use this?  What kind of course (programming, systems, theory) is it? What level of course (foundational, intermediate, advanced) is it?  Does it have any software or hardware requirements? What technology and background knowledge would students need? Does it make any other assumptions? With what other topics would you use this? in what kind of setting (lab, classroom, independent reading)? 

Student learning objectives
****************************

Think carefully about what you want students to *know* and *be able to do* by the end of each lesson and after completing the module. Then think about how you will *assess* whether they've gained these competencies (homework questions, programming projects, quiz or test questions, etc).

With those things in mind, write objectives with **active, measurable** language. For example, rather than *Students will be more knowledgeable about race conditions,* here are some more useful alternatives:
	- Students will **identify** race conditions in provided code.
	- Students will orally **define** and **give an example** of a race condition to a classmate.
	- Students will **describe** (and/or **implement**) a safer alternative to code containing potential race conditions.

The level of proficiency you expect of students is at your discretion, given their expertise and time constraints. Measurable doesn't necessarily have to mean a lengthier or more involved project: `here`_ is a list of action verbs for each stage of `Bloom's Taxonomy`_.

Create module content
*********************

To be written up as .rst files, eventually; see the template. It may be easier to write text first and then format it, although ReST is a very simple markdown language.


Write teaching notes and tips
*****************************

How do you use these pedagogical materials (active learning exercise, closed lab exercise, lecture, etc). What are anticipated sticky spots for students or things that took longer than you might think? Useful things to know about the software involved? Metaphors you've successfully used to explain the content? Preparations you typically make before using these materials?

Jot it all down - the less other instructors have to try to read your mind or reinvent the wheel, the more everyone benefits. 

Create supporting exercises
***************************

Please list the assessment activities (in-class work, homework/programming problems, exam/quiz questions, etc.) that you use to evaluate your students (see SLOs above). As appropriate, add links to web pages or links to documents you upload to your folder.



Shared responsibilities
#######################

Determine metadata from controlled vocabulary
*********************************************
These tags are used to search the list of existing modules. If you'd like to add a term, contact rab@stolaf.edu or shoop@macalester.edu.

- Languages Supported: Scheme, Python, C++, C, Java, Any 

- Relevant Parallel Computing Concepts: Data Parallelism, Task Parallelism, Message Passing, Shared Memory, Distributed

- Recommended Teaching Level: Introductory, Intermediate, Advanced, Any 

- Possible Course Use: Introduction to Computer Science, Hardware Design, Software Design, Algorithm Design, Parallel Computing Systems, Programming Languages 

Create assessment questions
***************************

How will students demonstrate that they've learned what you expect them to learn? Writing learning objectives may have inspired thoughts in this area; if not, CSinParallel writers can lend a hand.

Create publication-quality content on csinparallel github repo
**************************************************************

Again, a shared responsibility - if you've already got material that's ready to go or you have time to flesh out your own outlines, excellent. If not, we can help you out.

Maintenance
***********

Will you have time to keep an eye on your module and make sure that the content doesn't get outdated when the next version of a language is released?
