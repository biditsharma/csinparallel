Module Developers' Guide
========================

<<<<<<< HEAD
The following chapters describe various parts of the CSinParallel module development process.  We create modules using the sphinx documentation system, an open-source project used by the python community to generate documentation.  Files of content are written using reStructuredText.   We keep the modules
under source control on github.com. The first three chapters describe these aspects.

The chapter entitled *The CSinParallel Module Development Process* describes the details of how to work on
modules using our git-based development process with branching.

The reStructuredText file used to create the chapter called *New Module Template* can be used as an initial guide for any chapter you might write for a module you are working on.

Besides the module content written in reStructuredText, there are several other components that go into a module that will be published on csinparallel.org. These are described in the chapter entitled *Components of a Module*.
