Parallel Haskell
============================================

As multi-core processors become standard in the world of modern computing, it is increasingly important that computer science undergraduate students are taught parallel programming. Thus far, the parallel computing curriculum has focused on low-level parallelism techniques, such as MPI and explicit threading. In this module, we introduce a speculative educational module based on the functional programming language Haskell and its high-level parallel language constructs. We draw from our own experiences learning the language in order to assess the value of Haskell as an effective introduction to parallel programming.

Haskell is a powerful and versatile parallel language that could be added to the undergraduate classroom. This parallel programming module is put forward with the intention to be a part of an algorithms, programming languages, or operating systems course. 

This module was created by Lewis and Clark College's Parallel Programming research team; Kyle Barton [kjbarton@lclark.edu], Sam Dodson [sdodson@lclark.edu], Danielle Fenske [dfenske@lclark.edu], and Ben Whitehead [benw@lclark.edu], with the guidance of Professor Jens Mache [jmache@lclark.edu]. June 2013.
