This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life.  It uses the "brute-force"
algorithm and shows the grid in a window using OpenGL.  

*************************  
Building the executables 
-------------------------

Two executables can be built:

`openmp-life', which uses OpenMP for the computation. To build this executable,
type `make openmp-life'.

`cuda-life', which uses CUDA for the computation. To build this executable, type
`make cuda-life'.

The OpenGL library, the OpenGL Utility library, the OpenGL Utility Toolkit
library, and the OpenGL Extension Wrangler library are required.  Also,
`cuda-life' (obviously) requires CUDA.  (We have all this stuff on the
LittleFe.)

***********************
Running the executables
-----------------------

Run either executable with the `--help' argument to see the command line
options.  Running either executable with no command line options will start up a
simulation using a default pattern (the R pentonimo).

When I was testing the program I would connect to the LittleFe using a VNC
viewer, then run the program using VirtualGL:

vncviewer littlefe::5901
vglrun ~/life/cuda-life

*************
Pattern files 
-------------

The directory `patterns' contains some patterns.  Some were found on the
Internet and some are distributed with Golly.  The ones in `patterns/lifep' seem
to work all right.
