<h1>Infectious Disease<a class="headerlink" href="#infectious-disease" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><strong>By Aaron Weeden, Shodor Education Foundation, Inc.</strong> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<p><strong>Heavily modified by Yu Zhao, Macalester College</strong></p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>Epidemiology is the study of infectious disease. Infectious diseases are
said to be “contagious” among people if they are transmittable from one
person to another. Epidemiologists can use models to assist them in
predicting the behavior of infectious diseases. This module will develop
a simple agent-based infectious disease model, develop a parallel
algorithm based on the model, provide a coded implementation for the
algorithm, and explore the scaling of the coded implementation on high
performance cluster resources.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-assessment Rubric</strong></p>
<p>This rubric is to gauge students’ initial knowledge and experience with
the materials presented in this module. Students are asked to rate their
knowledge and experience on the following scale and in the following
subject areas:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Scale</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>no knowledge, no experience</li>
<li>very little knowledge, very little experience</li>
<li>some knowledge, some experience</li>
<li>a good amount of knowledge, a good amount of experience</li>
<li>high level of knowledge, high level of experience</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Subject areas</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Disease modeling</li>
<li>Parallel Algorithm Design</li>
<li>Parallel Hardware</li>
<li>MPI programming</li>
<li>OpenMP programming</li>
<li>Using a cluster</li>
<li>Scaling parallel code</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Model</strong></p>
<p>The model makes certain assumptions about the spread of the disease. In
particular, it assumes that the disease spreads from one person to
another person with some “contagiousness factor”, that is, some percent
chance that the disease will be transmitted. The model further assumes
that diseases can only be spread from a person who is carrying the
disease, a so-called “infected” person, to a person who is capable of
becoming infected, also known as a “susceptible” person. The disease is
assumed to have a certain incubation period, or “duration” – a length of
time during which the disease remains in the person. The disease is also
assumed to be transmittable only within a certain distance, or
“infection radius”, from a person capable of transmitting the disease.
The model further assumes that each person moves randomly at most 1 unit
in a given direction each day. Finally, the model assumes that after the
duration of the disease within a person, the person can become either
“immune” to the disease, incapable of being further infected or of
infecting other people but still able to move around, or “dead”,
incapable of being further infected, infecting other people, or moving.</p>
<p>The description below explains the various entities in the model. Things
in underlines are entities, things in <strong>bold</strong> are attributes of the
entities, and things in <em>italics</em> refer to entities found elsewhere in
the description.</p>

<li>Has a certain <strong>state</strong>, which can be either ‘susceptible’, ‘infected’, ‘immune’, or ‘dead’. States are stored in the memories of <em>processes</em> and <em>threads</em>. They can also be represented by color (black for susceptible, red for infected, green for immune, no color for dead), or by a ASCII character (o for susceptible, X for infected, I for immune, no character for dead).</li>

<p><strong>Introduction to Parallelism</strong></p>
<p>In parallel processing, rather than having a single program execute
tasks in a sequence, the program is split among multiple “execution
flows” executing tasks in parallel, i.e. at the same time. The term
“execution flow” refers to a discrete computational entity that performs
processes autonomously. A common synonym is “execution context”; “flow”
is chosen here because it evokes the stream of instructions that each
entity processes.</p>
<p>Execution flows have more specific names depending on the flavor of
parallelism being utilized. In “distributed memory” parallelism, in
which execution flows keep their own private memories (separate from the
memories of other execution flows), execution flows are known as
“processes”. In order for one process to access the memory of another
process, the data must be communicated, commonly by a technique known as
“message passing”. The standard of message passing considered in this
module is defined by the “Message Passing Interface (MPI)”, which
defines a set of primitives for packaging up data and sending them
between processes.</p>
<p>In another flavor of parallelism known as “shared memory”, in which
execution flows share a memory space among them, the execution flows are
known as “threads”. Threads are able to read and write to and from
memory without having to send messages. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id2">[2]</a> The standard for shared
memory considered in this module is OpenMP, which uses a series of
“pragma”s, or directives for specifying parallel regions of code to be
executed by threads. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id7" id="id3">[3]</a></p>
<p>A third flavor of parallelism is known as “hybrid”, in which both
distributed and shared memory are utilized. In hybrid parallelism, the
problem is broken into tasks that each process executes in parallel; the
tasks are then broken further into subtasks that each of the threads
execute in parallel. After the threads have executed their sub-tasks,
the processes use the shared memory to gather the results from the
threads, use message passing to gather the results from other processes,
and then move on to the next tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Parallel Hardware</strong></p>
<p>In order to use parallelism, the underlying hardware needs to support
it. The classic model of the computer, first established by John von
Neumann in the 20:math:<cite>{}^{th}</cite> century, has a single CPU connected to
memory. Such an architecture does not support parallelism because there
is only one CPU to run a stream of instructions. In order for
parallelism to occur, there must be multiple processing units running
multiple streams of instructions. “Multi-core” technology allows for
parallelism by splitting the CPU into multiple compute units called
cores. Parallelism can also exist between multiple “compute nodes”,
which are computers connected by a network. These computers may
themselves have multi-core CPUs, which allows for hybrid parallelism:
shared memory between the cores and message passing between the compute
nodes.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Motivation for Parallelism</strong></p>
<p>We now know what parallelism is, but why should we use it? The three
motivations we will discuss here are speedup, accuracy, and scaling.
These are all compelling advantages for using parallelism, but some also
exhibit certain limitations that we will also discuss.</p>
<p>“Speedup” is the idea that a program will run faster if it is
parallelized as opposed to executed serially. The advantage of speedup
is that it allows a problem to be modeled <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id8" id="id4">[4]</a> faster. If multiple
execution flows are able to work at the same time, the work will be
finished in less time than it would take a single execution flow.</p>
<p>“Accuracy” is the idea of forming a better solution to a problem. If
more processes are assigned to a task, they can spend more time doing
error checks or other forms of diagnostics to ensure that the final
result is a better approximation of the problem that is being modeled.
In order to make a program more accurate, speedup may need to be
sacrificed.</p>
<p>“Scaling” is perhaps the most promising of the three. Scaling says that
more parallel processors can be used to model a bigger problem in the
same amount of time it would take fewer parallel processors to model a
smaller problem. A common analogy to this is that one person in one boat
in one hour can catch a lot fewer fish than ten people in ten boats in
one hour.</p>
<p>There are issues that limit the advantages of parallelism; we will
address two in particular. The first, communication overhead, refers to
the time that is lost waiting for communications to take place before
and after calculations. During this time, valuable data is being
communicated, but no progress is being made on executing the algorithm.
The communication overhead of a program can quickly overwhelm the total
time spent modeling the problem, sometimes even to the point of making
the program less efficient than its serial counterpart. Communication
overhead can thus mitigate the advantages of parallelism.</p>
<p>A second issue is described in an observation put forth by Gene Amdahl
and is commonly referred to as “Amdahl’s Law”. Amdahl’s Law says that
the speedup of a parallel program will be limited by its serial regions,
or the parts of the algorithm that cannot be executed in parallel.
Amdahl’s Law posits that as the number of processors devoted to the
problem increases, the advantages of parallelism diminish as the serial
regions become the only part of the code that take significant time to
execute. In other words, a parallel program can only execute as fast as
its serial regions. Amdahl’s Law is represented as an equation in Figure
2.</p>
<p>Speedup = <img class="math" src="../_images/math/a0aa83e8e15f010dd702b795e7bb695ebd4ea3cd.png" alt="\frac{1}{1-P+\frac{P}{N}}"/></p>
<p>where</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>P = the proportion of the program that can be made parallel</li>
<li>1 – P = the proportion of the program that cannot be made parallel</li>
<li>N = the number of processors</li>
</ul>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Figure 2: Amdahl’s Law</strong></p>
<p>Amdahl’s Law provides a strong and fundamental argument against
utilizing parallel processing to achieve speedup. However, it does not
provide a strong argument against using it to achieve accuracy or
scaling. The latter of these is particularly promising, as it allows for
bigger classes of problems to be modeled as more processors become
available to the program. The advantages of parallelism for scaling are
summarized by John Gustafson in Gustafson’s Law, which says that bigger
problems can be modeled in the same amount of time as smaller problems
if the processor count is increased. Gustafson’s Law is represented as
an equation in Figure 3.</p>
<p>Speedup(N) = <img class="math" src="../_images/math/4cf8a95741445486b25d66f187e971d935f1a59d.png" alt="N–(1–P)*(N–1)"/></p>
<p>where</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>N = the number of processors</li>
<li>1–P = the proportion of the program that cannot be made parallel</li>
</ul>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Figure 3: Gustafson’s Law</strong></p>
<p>Amdahl’s Law reveals the limitations of what is known as “strong
scaling”, in which the number of processes remains constant as the
problem size increases. Gustafson’s Law reveals the promise of “weak
scaling”, in which the number of processes increases along with the
problem size. These concepts will be explored further in Exercise 4.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Code</strong></p>
<p>The code in this module is written in the C programming language, chosen
for its ubiquity in scientific computing as well as its well-defined use
of MPI and OpenMP.</p>
<p>The code is attached to this module in pandemic.zip. After unpacking
this using an archive utility, use of the code will require the use of a
command line terminal. C is a compiled language, so it must be run
through a compiler first to check for any syntax errors in the code. To
compile the code in all its forms of parallelism, enter “make all” in
the terminal. For other compilation options, see the Makefile. To run
the program, enter “./pandemic.serial” to run the serial (non-parallel)
version, “./pandemic.openmp” to run the OpenMP version, “mpirun –np
&lt;number of processes&gt; pandemic.mpi” to run the MPI
version, or “mpirun –np &lt;number of processes&gt;
pandemic.hybrid” to run the hybrid OpenMP/MPI version. Each version of
the code can be run with different options by appending arguments to the
end of commands, as in “./pandemic.serial –n 100”. These options are
described below:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>-n &lt;the number of people in the model&gt;</li>
<li>-i &lt;the number of initially infected people&gt;</li>
<li>–w &lt;the width of the environment&gt;</li>
<li>–h &lt;the height of the environment&gt;</li>
<li>–t &lt;the number of time days in the model&gt;</li>
<li>–T &lt;the duration of the disease (in days)&gt;</li>
<li>–c &lt;the contagiousness factor of the disease&gt;</li>
<li>–d &lt;the infection radius of the disease&gt;</li>
<li>–D &lt;the deadliness factor of the disease&gt;</li>
<li>–m &lt;the number of actual microseconds in between days of the model&gt; – this is used to slow or speed up the animation of the model</li>
</ul>
