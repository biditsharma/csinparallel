Introduction
############

Modern graphics cards are composed of many processors capable of computing hundreds of threads simultaneously. In this module we will use the CUDA platform to give our code access to the massive computing power of these cards.

What is CUDA?
#############

CUDA is a free proprietary platform designed by NVIDIA specifically for NVIDIA devices. It allows us to transfer memory between the GPU and CPU and run code on either device. CUDA code is written in an extended version of C and CUDA files have the prefix .cu they are compiled by NVIDIA's nvcc compiler.

Getting Started

TODO: set up instructions maybe use devices.cu?
Download the vectorAdd.cu and Makefile TODO make those links.
TODO more specific machine instructions.
