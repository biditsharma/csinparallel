Timing CUDA Operations
================================================

This module was created by Joel Adams of Calvin College and extended and adapted
for CSInParallel by Jeffrey Lyman in 2014 (JLyman@macalester.edu) 

The purpose of this document is to teach students the basics of 
CUDA programming and to give them an understanding of when it is
appropriate to offload work to the GPU.

Though completion of Vector Addition, multipliction, square root,
and squaring programs, students will gain an understanding of 
when the overhead of creating threads and copying memory is worth
the speedup of CPU coding
