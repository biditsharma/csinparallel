CUDA For C Novices
==============================================
This module is for students learning CUDA who are new to C. It introduces the basics you will need to know through a lab activity and some follow-up questions. Here are the two code samples you will need (they are also written out in this module). 
	* addVectors.cu_
	* divergence.cu_

	.. _addVectors.cu: C:\Users\Dani\Documents\SCHOOL\Parallel\GitHub\csinparallel\modules\CUDAForCNovices\source\addVectors.cu
	.. _divergence.cu: C:\Users\Dani\Documents\SCHOOL\Parallel\GitHub\csinparallel\modules\CUDAForCNovices\source\divergence.cu

This lab was created by Professor David Bunde of Knox College.
