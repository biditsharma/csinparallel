Welcome to Jetson TK Installation Guide's documentation!
========================================================

This guide is intended to help you set up your NVIDIA Jetson TK 
device for CUDA Programming. 
It's goal is to simplify NVIDIA's poorly organized support
website. However the website has more detail so if you find 
yourself stumped by this guide, try poking through
`NVIDIA's Support Site. <https://developer.nvidia.com/jetson-tk1-support>`_
