Mandelbrot pthreads Excercise
*****************************

In this excercise, you’ll look at using pthreads to create multiple threads to speed up a computationally-intensive task. 

The files that you should download (mandelbrot.c and bmp.h) are a program to draw an image. 

Compile them with

  gcc -Wall -std=c99 -o mandelbrot mandelbrot.c

and run the resulting executable; it takes a single command line argument, which should be a filename ending in .bmp. This extension stands for “bitmap”, which is a graphics format. The program will create the file whose name you give.
