Moore's law notes that processing power doubles about every two years. Computers have seen the benefit of this observation since the 1970's, as we have increased the number of transistors on a chip and the clock speed of the chips. However, physical limitations with heat and space have limited our potential to improve individual processors, and now we focus on putting more core processing elements on each chip.

We can easily take advantage of a few processors by assigning each core to a different program, but as we build computers with more processors and write programs with higher computational needs, we run into limits with traditional programming. We need to write code in such a way that one application can take advantage of many processors.
