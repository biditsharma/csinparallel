*****************
Mandelbrot OpenMP
*****************

In this lab, you’ll look at using OpenMP to use multiple threads to speed up a computationally-intensive task.

The files that you should download (:download:`mandelbrot.c <mandelbrot.c` and :download:`bmp.h <bmp.h>`) are a program to draw an image. Compile them with

.. code-block::

  gcc -Wall -std=c99 -o mandelbrot mandelbrot.c

and run the resulting executable; it takes a single command line argument, which should be a filename ending in .bmp. This extension stands for “bitmap”, which is a graphics format. The program will create the file whose name you give.
