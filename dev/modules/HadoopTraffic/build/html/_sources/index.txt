Hadoop Traffic Analysis 
=======================

This module was created for CSInParallel by Jeffrey Lyman in 2014
(JLyman@macalester.edu) 

The purpose of this module is to teach students how to process
large datasets using the Hadoop framework. It is assumed that
students are already familiar with the basics of hadoop and 
CSInParallel's Web Map Reduce hadoop interface.

The exercises in this module all use a dataset of UK traffic
incedents between 1974 and 2004. It contains 3 different cvs
files that contain information about accidents, casualties,
and vehicles. Over the course of this module students will 
learn how to create wmr jobs that combine input from all 
three files.
