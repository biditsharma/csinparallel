Hadoop Traffic Analysis 
=======================

This module was created for CSInParallel by Jeffrey Lyman in 2014
(JLyman@macalester.edu) 

The purpose of this module is to teach students how to analyze
networks and datasets distributed over multiple files using the 
Hadoop framework. It is assumed that students are already 
familiar with the basics of hadoop and CSInParallel's Web Map 
Reduce hadoop interface.

The excersises in this module use two datasets. The first is a
network of friendships on the social movie recommendation site
Flixster. Students will use it to learn how to analyze networks
and chain jobs. The second dataset comes from the UK department
of Transportaion and contains detailed records of traffic
accidents split into three separate files. Students will use 
this dataset to learn how to analyze data split across multiple
files.
