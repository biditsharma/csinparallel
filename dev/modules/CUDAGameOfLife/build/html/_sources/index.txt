CUDA Game of Life Module
==============================================

This module was written November 22nd, 2011 by Julian Dale (jdale@lclark.edu) and Christopher Mitchell (chrism@lclark.edu) from Lewis and Clark College in Portland, OR.

The purpose of this document is to give a high-level overview of some of the concepts necessary to understand how one might write software that uses CUDA. Even though you will see some code and syntax, this document does not aim to teach how to write CUDA applications.
