Hadoop LastFM Analysis's 
========================

This module demonstrates how hadoop and WMR can be used to
analize the lastFM million song dataset. It encorporates several
advanced hadoop techniques such as job chaining and multiple
input. Students should know how to use the WMR hadoop interface
before beginning this module. It is also highly recommended that
they work through the Advanced Hadoop module first, though it is
not strictly necessary as this module explains all the techniques
it uses, albeit in less depth than the advanced hadoop module.
