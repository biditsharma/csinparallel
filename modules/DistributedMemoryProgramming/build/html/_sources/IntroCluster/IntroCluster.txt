Introduction to Cluster
=======================

**Definition**: A cluster is a type of parallel or distributed processing system, which consists of a collection of interconnected stand-alone computers cooperatively working together as a single, integrated computing resource. 

A cluster is usually a linux-based operating system, and it is called *Beowulf Cluster*. There are two parallel models for a cluster:

	- Shared memory
	- Distributed memory

We want to introduce you to a distributed memory model of parallel programming. These clusters are made of many individual nodes, each node contains at least one processor, a motherboard, memory, and network to connect to other nodes .etc. They do not share memory space.
