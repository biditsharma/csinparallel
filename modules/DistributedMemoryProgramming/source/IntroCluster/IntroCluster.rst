Introduction to Cluster
=======================

**Definition**: A cluster is a type of parallel or distributed processing system, which consists of a collection of interconnected stand-alone computers cooperatively working together as a single, integrated computing resource. 

A cluster is usually a linux-based operating system, and it is called *Beowulf Cluster*. There are two parallel models for a cluster:

	- Shared memory computing
	- Distributed memory computing

Some benefits of using clusters are:

	- Inexpensive: Hardware and software of a cluster cost significantly much less than those of supercomputer.
	- Scalability
	- Adaptability
	- Faster Technology Innovation

In order to use a cluster effectively, we need to have some programming environments such as Message Passing Interface (MPI), and OpenMP.etc. In this module, we will be learning about MPI on distributed memory cluster. These clusters are made of many individual nodes, each node contains at least one processor, a motherboard, memory, and network to connect to other nodes .etc. They do not share memory space.
