Drug Design Exemplar
================================================

In this document we present a problem from molecular biology and chemistry that requires computation to solve.  The real-world problem is fairly complex.  Here we simplify it to present the essence of the problem being solved.  We call this problem description and it solutions an *exemplar* of the original real-world computation.  In this document we introduce the problem and provide one form of sequential programmed solution.  In a follow-up document there are parallel programming solutions using different languages and computing hardware and software.
