\textbf{Prologue}

This lab activity asks you to complete some code provided so that it is able to crawl the web from a given starting URL.  You will start by completing a sequential version of this code.  Then you will work on a version that uses the libraries from java.util.concurrent to create a multi-threaded version.

\textbf{Prerequisites}

Some existing knowledge of the Java data structures LinkedList and ArrayList is necessary.

\textbf{Code}

Please download \code{ConcurrentDataStructures.jar}. Inside the src directory are two packages: one for the original sequential web crawler called lab/spider, and another for the threaded spider called lab/concurrentSpider. The first chapter linked below starts you out with the sequential spider using conventional Java data structures to hold the URLs it encounters. You will then continue on to create the threaded version, starting with this code provided.


\chapter{A Single-process Web Crawler, or Spider}
\label{TheSpiderLabonecrawler/TheSpiderLabonecrawler::doc}\label{TheSpiderLabonecrawler/TheSpiderLabonecrawler:concurrent-data-structures-in-java}\label{TheSpiderLabonecrawler/TheSpiderLabonecrawler:a-single-process-web-crawler-or-spider}
The World Wide web is aptly named when you consider the URL links
found in pages.  One page can have many links in it that take a
viewer to another page, which has more links, and so on, forming a
very large cyclic graph of interconnected pages.  In this lab you
will be finishing some code for a web crawler, or spider, that will
start with a ‘seed’ URL to a web page and read it to find links to
other pages.  Those links will be placed on a queue for further
processing (we’ll call this the work queue).  When the initial page
is processed, it is placed on another data structure to indicate
that it has been visited.  This process is repeated for the next
page whose link is on the work queue.  The code you will be given
uses a Java library for parsing html files and looking for links
(java.net.URL).


\section{To Start With}
\label{TheSpiderLabonecrawler/TheSpiderLabonecrawler:to-start-with}
Here are the files in the package lab.spider, which you will use as
your starting point:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
AllWordsCounter.java    // contains a ‘dictionary’ to hold counts of how often a URL is encounterd

HttpHelper.java         // contains methods to read html pages and extract links; also can detect whether a URL is an image

RunSpider.java          // has main()

Spider.java             // the workhorse and the one you will be changing

TestHttpHelper.java     // JUnit test class

TestSpider.java         // JUnit test class

WordCount.java          // small helper class that holds a word and a count
\end{Verbatim}

Start by creating lab.spider in your own repository and copying
these files.

The Spider.java class is the one that you should work on for this
assignment.  The RunSpider class contains main() and uses it.  As
the code stands now it doesn’t really do anything if you run it.

Examine the code in the files.  Begin by creating a class diagram
that shows which classes ‘use’ or ‘have’ one of the other classes.


\subsection{To Do}
\label{TheSpiderLabonecrawler/TheSpiderLabonecrawler:to-do}
Your task is to finish the Spider class by doing the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Complete the processPage method.  When it works, one of the TestSpider unit tests should pass.

\item {} 
Complete the crawl() method.  When it works, both TestSpider unit tests should pass.

\end{itemize}

\begin{notice}{note}{Note:}
There are comments in these methods to help assist you.
\end{notice}

Once your unit tests pass, you should be able to run the code,
which is currently ‘hard-coded’ to start at macalester.edu, and see
it produce the URLs found when crawling, along with how many times
it saw them.
\setbox0\vbox{

\textbf{Try This:}

\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Experiment with this variable found in Spider:  maxurls     If you double it, how many new urls were encountered?  You might want to make a method that would answer this for you.

\item {} 
Experiment with the BEGNNING\_URL variable found in RunSpider by choosing some other pages of interest to you as starting points.

\chapter{Improving the Spider}
\label{SpiderLabpart2/SpiderLabpart2:improving-the-spider}\label{SpiderLabpart2/SpiderLabpart2::doc}

\section{First Question: How much work is there?}
\label{SpiderLabpart2/SpiderLabpart2:first-question-how-much-work-is-there}
Once you have a completed working spider, let’s examine how much
work it has to do.  Try some experiments in which you continue
using increasing values of maxUrls in the Spider.  Please note that
you can provide this value in its constructor.  Add a method to the
Spider that enables you to ask how many pages are still left to
work on in the ‘work’ queue.  You may also want to add a method to
know how many pages have been finished.

Change the RunSpider class to run some experiments with different
values of maxUrls by executing several Spiders.  For each value of
maxUrls, report on how much work is left to do.  How quickly is our
Spider overloaded with work?


\section{Multiple Spiders to the rescue}
\label{SpiderLabpart2/SpiderLabpart2:multiple-spiders-to-the-rescue}
Now let’s examine how we can use multiple spiders working at the
same time on this problem.  Your instructor will take a moment to
explain how we will use a technique called threads to run many
spiders at the same time, each of who will access the work,
finished, and urlCounter queue.  Then you will try this out below.

There is now a new lab.concurrentSpider package in our shared
space.  Examine the RunThreadedSpider class.  Note that we now use
a Java class called a Thread to begin running multiple instances of
the Spider in many Threads.  The Spider is now in a class called
ConcurrentSpider, and implements an interface called Runnable.

A key feature of concurrently running Spiders is that they must
share the same data structures in order to work together.  To do
this, we need to place the data structures they are working on in
one class and create one instance of that class in
RunConcurrentSpider.  Then each new ‘Runnable’ ConcurrentSpider
will receive a reference to that class of shared data structures.
We provide a class called lab.concurrentSpider.SharedSpiderData for this purpose.


\section{First try:  share our original data structures?}
\label{SpiderLabpart2/SpiderLabpart2:first-try-share-our-original-data-structures}
We could attempt to use the original LinkedList and ArrayList data structures and share those among the threads.  However, these are not `thread safe', that is they are not guaranteed to behave properly when multiple threads are accessing and updating them at the same time.


\section{Second try: concurrent data structures}
\label{SpiderLabpart2/SpiderLabpart2:second-try-concurrent-data-structures}
To ensure our code will work correctly using multiple threads, we will
use the new Java Concurrent Data
Structures from the package java.util.concurrent.  Begin with the
file SharedSpiderData to see the types of shared, thread-safe data
structures we will use for this version of the multi-threaded
crawler.


\subsection{To Do}
\label{SpiderLabpart2/SpiderLabpart2:to-do}
Finish the classes called ConcurrentSpider and RunThreadedSpider.  You will need to discover what methods on the concurrent data structures (ArrayBlockingQueue, ConcurrentLinkedQueue) are available for adding and removing elements.
\setbox0\vbox{
\begin{minipage}{0.95\linewidth}
\textbf{Try This:}

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
You can try using different numbers of threads, depending on how much your machine can handle.

\item {} 
Experiment with this variable found in ComcurrentSpider:  \emph{maxurls}     If you double it, how many new urls were encountered?  Now that you have all these spider threads, you can likely scrape more URLs.

\item {} 
Experiment with the BEGNNING\_URL variable found in RunSpider by choosing some other pages of interest to you as starting points.
