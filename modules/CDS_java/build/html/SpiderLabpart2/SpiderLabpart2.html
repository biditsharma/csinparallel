<h2>First Question: How much work is there?<a class="headerlink" href="#first-question-how-much-work-is-there" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once you have a completed working spider, let’s examine how much
work it has to do. &nbsp;Try some experiments in which you continue
using increasing values of maxUrls in the Spider. &nbsp;Please note that
you can provide this value in its constructor. &nbsp;Add a method to the
Spider that enables you to ask how many pages are still left to
work on in the ‘work’ queue. &nbsp;You may also want to add a method to
know how many pages have been finished.</p>
<p>Change the RunSpider class to run some experiments with different
values of maxUrls by executing several Spiders. &nbsp;For each value of
maxUrls, report on how much work is left to do. &nbsp;How quickly is our
Spider overloaded with work?</p>

<div class="section" id="multiple-spiders-to-the-rescue">
<h2>Multiple Spiders to the rescue<a class="headerlink" href="#multiple-spiders-to-the-rescue" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now let’s examine how we can use multiple spiders working at the
same time on this problem. &nbsp;Your instructor will take a moment to
explain how we will use a technique called threads to run many
spiders at the same time, each of who will access the work,
finished, and urlCounter queue. &nbsp;Then you will try this out below.</p>
<p>There is now a new lab.concurrentSpider package in our shared
space. &nbsp;Examine the RunThreadedSpider class. &nbsp;Note that we now use
a Java class called a Thread to begin running multiple instances of
the Spider in many Threads. &nbsp;The Spider is now in a class called
ConcurrentSpider, and implements an interface called Runnable.</p>
<p>A key feature of concurrently running Spiders is that they must
share the same data structures in order to work together.&nbsp; To do
this, we need to place the data structures they are working on in
one class and create one instance of that class in
RunConcurrentSpider. &nbsp;Then each new ‘Runnable’ ConcurrentSpider
will receive a reference to that class of shared data structures.
We provide a class called lab.concurrentSpider.SharedSpiderData for this purpose.</p>

<div class="section" id="first-try-share-our-original-data-structures">
<h2>First try: &nbsp;share our original data structures?<a class="headerlink" href="#first-try-share-our-original-data-structures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We could attempt to use the original LinkedList and ArrayList data structures and share those among the threads.  However, these are not &#8216;thread safe&#8217;, that is they are not guaranteed to behave properly when multiple threads are accessing and updating them at the same time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="second-try-concurrent-data-structures">
<h2>Second try: concurrent data structures<a class="headerlink" href="#second-try-concurrent-data-structures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To ensure our code will work correctly using multiple threads, we will
use the new Java Concurrent Data
Structures from the package java.util.concurrent. &nbsp;Begin with the
file SharedSpiderData to see the types of shared, thread-safe data
structures we will use for this version of the multi-threaded
crawler.</p>
<div class="section" id="to-do">
<h3>To Do<a class="headerlink" href="#to-do" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Finish the classes called ConcurrentSpider and RunThreadedSpider.  You will need to discover what methods on the concurrent data structures (ArrayBlockingQueue, ConcurrentLinkedQueue) are available for adding and removing elements.</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title first">Try This:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You can try using different numbers of threads, depending on how much your machine can handle.</li>
<li>Experiment with this variable found in ComcurrentSpider: &nbsp;<cite>maxurls</cite> &nbsp; &nbsp; If you double it, how many new urls were encountered? &nbsp;Now that you have all these spider threads, you can likely scrape more URLs.</li>
<li>Experiment with the BEGNNING_URL variable found in RunSpider by choosing some other pages of interest to you as starting points.</li>
