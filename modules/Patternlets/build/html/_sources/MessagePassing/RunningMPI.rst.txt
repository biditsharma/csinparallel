Running the examples on your cluster
======================================

The MPI examples given in the next few chapters show how to compile and run the
code examples. Running an MPI job on a cluster can vary depending on the system
(multicore or cluster) and particular MPI package that is installed on the system.
Here are a few pointers about running them for your particular system.
You will have to know what type of system and which MPI package is installed
to know what will work for you for these examples.
