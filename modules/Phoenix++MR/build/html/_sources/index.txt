Welcome to the module for introducing students to MapReduce with Phoenix++! 
The first section, *What is MapReduce?* introduces students to the overall 
paradigm of MapReduce, discusses the history of Phoenix++ MapReduce, and how it 
differs from Hadoop and Google MapReduce. The next section, *Counting Pease 
with MapReduce* discusses how to use MapReduce to count words in a file, using 
a famous poem from Mother Goose. The third section, entitled *Getting Started 
with Phoenix++*, explores the Phoenix++ code base, discusses files required for 
custom implementations, and gives an overview of the word count example provided 
by the framework.
