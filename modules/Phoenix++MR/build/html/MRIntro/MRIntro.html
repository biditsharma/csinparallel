<p>In today&#8217;s world, multicore architectures are ubiquitous. But, the majority of
programs that people write are still serial. Why is that? While some people may
be unaware that they can leverage the multiple cores on their computers, the
truth is that parallel computing is very difficult. In many cases, the
programmer must consider many factors that have nothing to do with problem he
or she is trying to parallelize. For example, to implement a program in Pthreads,
a programmer must physically allocate, create and join any threads they want to
use. The programmer must also be aware of data races, and use synchronization
constructs as necessary.</p>
<p>This is not unique to Pthreads. In MPI for example, you have to explicitly
specify what messages you want to send to what node, and how to synchronize
messages. As you can imagine, this creates a lot of overhead for the
programmer. As those who have programmed previously in Pthreads, MPI, or OpenMP
can attest, debugging parallel programs can be very difficult! When things
execute in parallel, they execute <em>non-deterministically</em>. This <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbounded_nondeterminism">non-determinism</a>
can cause a lot of headaches.</p>
<p>As multicore and parallel systems became more prevalent, computer scientists
began to ask the question if parallel computing is harder that it needs to be.
Some libraries such as OpenMP &#8220;hide&#8221; some of the work required with threads
through the use of pragmas. Hiding implementation details is known as
abstraction. However, even with abstraction, the programming still has to worry
a lot about the &#8220;management&#8221; aspects of the program. Furthermore, similar
applications can be parallelized in the way. Researchers began exploring ways
to create an automated framework for parallel computing.</p>

<h2>Enter MapReduce<a class="headerlink" href="#enter-mapreduce" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In 2004, Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawhat of Google <a class="reference external" href="http://static.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/osdi04/tech/full_papers/dean/dean_html/">published a paper</a> on the
MapReduce paradigm. Google uses MapReduce as the backbone of its search engine,
and uses it for multiple operations. It is important to note that Google did
<em>not</em> invent MapReduce; the paradigm has existed for decades in functional
languages. However, the paper&#8217;s release was a watershed moment in parallel
computing, and spelled the beginning of an upsurge in interest in the paradigm
that has led to many innovations over the last decade.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s implementation of MapReduce is closed source and proprietary. In 2006,
work on the <a class="reference external" href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> project was started by Doug Cutting, an employee of Yahoo!.
Hadoop is named after a plush toy elephant belonging to Cutting&#8217;s son, and the
eponymous elephant features prominently in the Hadoop logo. Over the last six
years, Hadoop has been widely adopted by many tech giants, including Amazon,
Facebook and Microsoft.</p>
<p>It is important to note that both Google&#8217;s implementation of MapReduce and
Hadoop MapReduce were designed for very large datasets, on the order of
hundreds of gigabytes and petabytes. The goal is to efficiently streamline the
processing of these large numbers of documents by distributing them over
thousands of machines. Note that for smaller datasets, the system may have
limited benefit; the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) can prove to be a
bottleneck. However, the concept of MapReduce is still very attractive to
programmers with smaller datasets or more limited computational resources, due
to its relative simplicity.</p>

<h2>Phoenix and Phoenix++<a class="headerlink" href="#phoenix-and-phoenix" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In 2007, a team at Stanford University led by Christos Kozyrakis began
exploring how to implement the MapReduce paradigm on multi-core platform. Their
thread-based solution, <a class="reference external" href="http://csl.stanford.edu/~christos/publications/2007.cmp_mapreduce.hpca.pdf">Phoenix</a>,
won best paper at HPCA&#8216;07, and has been cited over 900 times. An update on Phoenix (<a class="reference external" href="http://csl.stanford.edu/~christos/publications/2009.scalable_phoenix.iiswc.pdf">Phoenix 2</a>)
was released in 2009. In 2011, <a class="reference external" href="https://research.tableau.com/sites/default/files/mapreduce2011-talbot-phoenixplusplus.pdf">Phoenix++</a> was released.
A complete re-write of the earlier Phoenix systems, Phoenix++ enables
development in C++, and significantly modularizes and improves the
performance of the original code base.</p>
