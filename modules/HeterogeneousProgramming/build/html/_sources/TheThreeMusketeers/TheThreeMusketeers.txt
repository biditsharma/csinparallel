The Three Musketeers
=====================

Another Heterogeneous programming model that we can look at is the three parallel programming techniques combined MPI, CUDA, and OpenMP. Each of the parallel programming model uses different resource to work on their parallel model. OpenMP works on Multicore CPU, CUDA works on GPU, and MPI distributes the work among the nodes. Therefore, if you have a cluster, whose nodes contain more than one core, and GPU on them, you can try this parallel programming method. However, in this last section of the module we just want introduce the idea of having this hardcore parallelism.
