Hadoop Traffic Analysis 
=======================

This module was created for CSInParallel by Jeffrey Lyman in 2014
(JLyman@macalester.edu) 

The purpose of this module is to teach students how to analyze
datasets distributed over multiple files using the 
Hadoop framework. It is assumed that students are already 
familiar with the basics of hadoop and CSInParallel's Web Map 
Reduce hadoop interface.

The excersises in this module use a dataset from the UK 
department of Transportaion that contains detailed records of 
traffic accidents split into three separate files.


The dataset can be obtained from
`Academic Torrents <http://academictorrents.com/details/c7d2d7a91ae3fd0256dd2ba2d7344960cb3c4dbb>`_.
More about the source of this public data from the United Kingdom can be found on
`its Wikipedia page <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reported_Road_Casualties_Great_Britain>`_.
