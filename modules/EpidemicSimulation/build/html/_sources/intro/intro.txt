The field of epidemiology is the study of infectious diseases, and mathematical models are often used by epidemiologists to describe or predict the spread of disease. Here we present a simplified model of an infectious disease which is *contagious*, meaning spread from person to person.

The model describes a specific population and the current state of health of each member of the population. Possible states are **susceptible** (having the potential to get sick), **infected** (actively sick and able to spread the infection to others), **recovered** (no longer sick and incapable of getting sick again), and **dead** (no longer moving or spreading the infection). Based on the first three states of health, the model is called the *SIR model*. 

:note: This implementation ignores many facets of a real epidemic that would be considered in more sophisticated implementations, such as immunity, treatment, and births or non-epidemic related deaths in the population. You can read about more complex models `here`_.

The population starts out with an initial number infected. Associated with the particular infection being modeled are a *radius of transmission*\ , *contagiousness factor*\, *deadliness factor*\ , and *duration of illness*. 

	.. glossary::
		radius of transmission:
			distance within which a susceptible individual must be from an infected individual to become infected

	.. glossary::
		contagiousness factor:
			when a susceptible individual is within an infected individualâ€™s radius of transmission, the percent chance that transmission will occur from person to person and the susceptible individual will become infected

	.. glossary::
		deadliness factor:
			the percent chance that an infected individual will die

	.. glossary::
		duration of illness:
    		the length of time an infected individual remains sick and able to transmit the disease

These factors influence the spread of infectious disease and, as such, are the parameters used to control the mathematical model. We use Monte Carlo simulation techniques (running a simulation over and over again) to approximate this SIR model and thereby gather information on how a disease would progress through a population.
