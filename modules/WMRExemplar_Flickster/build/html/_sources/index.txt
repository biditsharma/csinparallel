Hadoop Network Analysis 
=======================

This module was created for CSInParallel by Jeffrey Lyman in 2014
(JLyman@macalester.edu) 

The purpose of this module is to teach students how to analyze
networks and datasets distributed over multiple files using the 
Hadoop framework. It is assumed that students are already 
familiar with the basics of hadoop and CSInParallel's Web Map 
Reduce (WMR) hadoop interface.

The excersises in this module use a network of friendships on 
the social movie recommendation site Flixster. Students will use
it to learn how to analyze networks
and chain jobs.

The dataset can be downloaded from `Academic Torrents <http://academictorrents.com/details/4960373ea6dec89153639b0975ea92f9e3d3c914>`_
