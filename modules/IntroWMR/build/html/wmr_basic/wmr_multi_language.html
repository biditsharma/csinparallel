<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For this activity, you need to have read the accompanying
background reading in the previous section entitled
<em>Using Parallelism to Analyze Very Large Files: Google&#8217;s MapReduce Paradigm</em>.</p>
<p>In this lab you will use a web-based program called <cite>WebMapReduce</cite>
(<strong>WMR</strong>) that enables you to formulate map-reduce computations and
run them on an underlying <em>Hadoop</em> map-reduce system running on a
cluster of computers.</p>
<p>You will use WebMapReduce on a cluster of computers at Saint Olaf
College. You should access WebMapReduce now and register for a
login by going to this URL on your web browser:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://cumulus.cs.stolaf.edu/wmr/">http://cumulus.cs.stolaf.edu/wmr/</a></p>
<p>Choose the link at the very upper right of this page that says
&#8216;Register&#8217;. Use your email address as your login name,
and provide the other information asked for. You choose your own
password, so that you can remember it and have control of your
account.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: To complete your registration, you will need a registration
key from your instructor.</p>
<p>For later reference, you may want to check this <a class="reference external" href="http://webmapreduce.sourceforge.net/docs/using/index.html">documentation for
WMR</a>.</p>
<p>For this activity, you should be able to follow along with the
instructions below and determine how to use WMR.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="an-example-of-map-reduce-computing-with-wmr-counting-words">
<h2>An example of map-reduce computing with WMR: counting words<a class="headerlink" href="#an-example-of-map-reduce-computing-with-wmr-counting-words" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To program with map-reduce, you must first decide how to use
mappers and reducers in order to accomplish your computational
goal. The mapper function should take a line of input and decompose
it somehow into key-value pairs; then the reducer should somehow
condense or analyze all the key-value pairs having a <em>common key</em>,
and produce a desired result.</p>
<p><em>The following example is small to illustrate how the process works.</em>
In realistic applications, which you will try later in this
activity and in homework, the input data is much larger (several to
hundreds of Gigabytes) and is stored in the Hadoop system. You will
go through the following exercise first to ensure that the code is
working and that you understand how it works. Then you can move on
to bigger files. This is the process you should go through when
doing this kind of coding: work on small amounts of data first to
ensure correctness of your code, then try larger amounts of data.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the problem of counting how frequently each
word appears in a collection of text data. For example, if the input
data in a file is:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>One fish, Two fish,
Red Fish, Blue fish.
Blue Fish, Two Fish.</pre>
</div>
<p>then the output should be:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Blue 2
One 1
Red 1
Two 2
fish, 2
Fish, 2
fish. 1
Fish. 1</pre>
</div>
<p>As this output indicates, we did not make any attempt to trim
punctuation characters in this first example. Nor did we consider that
some words in our text might be capatalized and some may not.
We will also not do so as we
practice using WebMapReduce with the initial functions described
below. However, you can consider adding punctuation removal and
lowercase conversion to your mapper code as you work through the example.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The WebMapReduce system will sort the words
according to the ASCII codes of the characters within words.</p>
</div>
<p>What follows is a plan for the mapper and reducer functions.</p>
<div class="section" id="map-reduce-plan">
<h3>Map-reduce plan<a class="headerlink" href="#map-reduce-plan" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In WMR, mapper functions work simultaneously on lines of input from
files, where a line ends with a newline charater. The mapper will
produce one key-value pair (<em>w</em>, <em>count</em>) for each and every word encountered
in the input line that it is working on.</p>
<p>Thus, on the above input, three mappers working together, one on each line,
could emit the following combined output:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>One 1
fish, 1
fish, 1
Two 1

Red 1
Fish, 1
Blue 1
fish. 1

Blue 1
Fish, 1
Two 1
Fish. 1</pre>
</div>
<p>The reducers will compute the sum of all the <em>count</em> values for a
given word <em>w</em>, then produce the key-value pair (<em>w</em>, <em>sum</em>).</p>
<p>In this example, we can envision a reducer for each distinct word found
by the three mappers, where the reducer gets a list of single counts
per occurance of the word that a mapper found, loking like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>One    [1]
fish,  [1, 1]
Two    [1,1]
Red    [1]
Fish,  [1,1]
Blue   [1,1]
fish.  [1]
Fish.  [1]</pre>
</div>
<p>Each reducer works on one of the pairs of data shown above, and the system
handles creating words with the lists of counts as shown above.</p>
</div>

<h2>One System, Many Languages<a class="headerlink" href="#one-system-many-languages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In map-reduce framework systems in general and in WMR specifically, you can
use one of several programming languages to code your mapper and reducer functions.

<h2>The mapper function<a class="headerlink" href="#the-mapper-function" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each mapper process is receiving a line from a file as its key initially
when the process starts (the value is empty, or null).  You write one mapper
function to be executed by those prcesses on any given line from any particular file.
Our goal is to have the mapper output a new (key, value) containing a word found
and the number one, as shown for the three-mapper example above.</p>
<p>Here is psedocode for what a typical mapper might accomplish:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># key is a single line from a file.
#
# value is empty in this case, since this is the first mapper function
# we are applying.
#
function mapper(key, value)
  1) Take the key argument to this function, which is the line of text,
     and split it on whitespace

  2) For every word resulting from the split key line:

      'emit' a pair (word, "1") to the system for the reducers to handle</pre>
</div>
<p>Here is a Python3 mapper function for accomplishing this task using
the WMR system. We include the feature of stripping away
puncuation characters from the input and converting each word found to
lowercase.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2

</pre></div>
</td></tr></table></div>
<p>This code is available for download in the table above, as are versions
in other languages.  Note that in each language you will need to know
how to specify the (key, value) pair to emit to the system for the reducers
to process. We see this for Python in line 4 above.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-reducer-function">
<h2>The reducer function<a class="headerlink" href="#the-reducer-function" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the system, there will be reducer processes to handle each word &#8216;key&#8217;
that was emitted by various mappers.  You write reducer code as if your reducer
function is getting one word key and a container of counts, where each count
came from a different mapper that was working on a different line of a file or files.
In this simplest example, each count is a &#8216;1&#8217;, each of which will be summed together
by the reducer handling the particular word as a key.</p>
<p>Pseudocode for a reducer for this problem looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># key is a single word, values is a 'container' of counts that were
# gathered by the system from every mapper
#
function reducer(key, values)

  set a sum accumulator to zero

  for each count in values
    accumulate the sum by adding count to it

  'emit' the (key, sum) pair</pre>

</pre></div>
</td></tr></table></div>
<p>This code is also available in the table above containing versions
in several languages.</p>
<p>The function <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">reducer()</span></tt> is called once for each distinct key
that appears among the key-value pairs emitted by the mapper, and
that call processes all of the key-value pairs that use that key.
On line 1, the two parameters that are arguments of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">reducer()</span></tt>
are that one distinct <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">key</span></tt> and a Python3 <em>iterator</em> (similar to a
list, but not quite) called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">values</span></tt>, which provides access to
all the values for that key. Iterators in Python3 are designed for
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for</span></tt> loops- note in line 3 that we can simply ask for each value
one at a time from the set of values held by the iterator.</p>
<p><em>Rationale:</em> WMR <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">reducer()</span></tt> functions use iterators instead of
lists because the number of values may be very large in the case of
large data. For example, there would be billions of occurrences of
the word &#8220;the&#8221; if our data consisted of all pages on the web. When
there are a lot of key-value pairs, it is more efficient to
dispense pairs one at a time through an iterator than to create a
gigantic complete list and hold that list in main memory; also, an
enormous list may overfill main memory.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">reducer()</span></tt> function adds up all the counts that appear in
key-value pairs for the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">key</span></tt> that appears as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">reducer()</span></tt>&#8216;s
first argument (recall these come from separate mappers). Each
count provided by the iterator <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">values</span></tt> is a string, so in line 4
we must first convert it to an integer before adding it to the
running total <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sum</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The method <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Wmr.emit()</span></tt> is used to produce key-value pairs as
output from the mapper. This time, only one pair is emitted,
consisting of the word being counted and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sum</span></tt>, which holds the
number of times that word appeared in <em>all</em> of the original data.</p>

<h2>Using WMR and its test mode<a class="headerlink" href="#using-wmr-and-its-test-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Here is some information about developing WMR map-reduce
programs,and what to do if something goes wrong with your WMR job.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>First, a reminder:<ul>
<li>At present, the WMR interface does not automatically reset radio
buttons for you when you upload a file or use <cite>Distributed
FileSystem</cite> data generated from a prior map-reduce run.
<em>Always check to see that the radio buttons select the data, mapper, and reducer resources you intend.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can test your mapper alone without using your reducer by
using the <em>identity reducer</em>, which simply emits the same key-value
pairs that it receives. Here is an implementation of the identity
reducer for Python:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">reducer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">iter</span><span class="p">):</span>

</pre></div>
</td></tr></table></div>
<p>As an example, if you use the word-count mapper with the identity reducer, then the &#8220;fish&#8221; data
above should produce the following output:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>Blue 1
Blue  1
fish, 1
fish, 1
fish. 1
Fish, 1
Fish, 1
Fish. 1
One 1
Red 1
Two 1
Two 1</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Observe that the output is sorted, due to the shuffling step.
However, this does show all the key-value pairs that result from
the word-count mapper.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Likewise, you can test your reducer alone without using your
mapper by substituting the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">identity</span> <span class="pre">mapper</span></tt>, which simply copies

enter your data in an editor, then cut and paste to enter that data
in the text box. Alternatively, you can&#8221;Upload&#8221; a file that

<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">In WMR, you can choose to use your own input data files. Try
choosing to &#8216;browse&#8217; for a file, and using this
<a class="reference download internal" href="../_downloads/mobydick.txt"><tt class="xref download docutils literal"><span class="pre">mobydick.txt</span></tt></a> as file
input.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">You have likely noticed that capitalized words are treated
separately from lowercase words. Change your mapper to also convert
each word to lowercase before checking whether it is in the
dictionary.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Also remove punctuation from each word after splitting the line
(so all the &#8216;fish&#8217; variations get counted together).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">There are a large number of files of books from Project
Gutenberg available on the Hadoop system underlying WebMapReduce.
First start by trying this book as an input file by choosing
&#8216;Cluster Path&#8217; as Input in WMR and typing one of these into the
text box:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">/shared/gutenberg/WarAndPeace.txt</div>
<div class="line">/shared/gutenberg/CompleteShakespeare.txt</div>
<div class="line">/shared/gutenberg/AnnaKarenina.txt</div>
</div>
<p>These books have many lines of text with &#8216;newline&#8217; chacters at the
end of each line. Each of you mapper functions works on one line.
Try one of these.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Next, you should try a collection of many books, each of which
has no newline characters in them. In this case, each mapper &#8216;task&#8217;
in Hadoop will work on one whole book (your dictionary of words per
mapper will be for the whole book, and the mappers will be running
on many books at one time). In the Hadoop file system inside WMR we
have these datasets available for this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="70%" />
<col width="30%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p class="first last">&#8216;Cluster path&#8217; to enter in WMR</p>
</th>
<th class="head"><p class="first last">Number of books</p>
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td><p class="first last">/shared/gutenberg/all_nonl/group10</p>
</td>
<td><p class="first last">2018</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p class="first last">/shared/gutenberg/all_nonl/group11</p>
</td>
<td><p class="first last">294</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p class="first last">/shared/gutenberg/all_nonl/group6</p>
</td>
<td><p class="first last">830</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p class="first last">/shared/gutenberg/all_nonl/group8</p>
</td>
<td><p class="first last">541</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div></blockquote>
<p>While using many books, it will be useful for you to experiment
with the different datasets so that you can get a sense for how
much a system like Hadoop can process.</p>
<p>To do this, it will also be useful for you to save your
configuration so that you can use it again with a different number
of reducer tasks. Once you have entered your mapper and reducer
code, picked the Python3 language, and given your job a descriptive
name, choose the <cite>&#8216;Save&#8217;</cite> button at the bottom of the WMR panel.
This will now be a <cite>&#8216;Saved Configuration&#8217;</cite> that you can retrieve
using the link on the left in the WMR page.</p>
<p>Try using the smallest set first (group11). Do not enter anything
in the map tasks box- notice that the system will choose the same
number of mappers as the number of books (this will show up once
you submit the job). Also do not enter anything for the number of
reduce tasks. With that many books, when the job completes you will
see there are many pages of output, and some interesting &#8216;words&#8217;.
For the 294 books in group11, note how you obtain several pages of
results. You will also notice that the stripping of punctuation
isn&#8217;t perfect. If you wish to try improving this you could, but it
is not necessary.</p>

<h2>Additional Notes<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-notes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is possible that input data files to mappers may be treated
differently than as described in the above example. For example, a
mapper function might be used as a second pass by operating on the
reducer results from a previous map-reduce cycle. Or the data may
be formatted differently than a text file from a novel or poem.
These notes pertain to those cases.</p>
<p>In WMR, each line of data is treated as a key-value pair of
strings, where the key consists of all characters before the first
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TAB</span></tt> character in that line, and the value consists of all
characters after that first <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TAB</span></tt> character. Each call of
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mapper()</span></tt> operates on one line and that function&#8217;s two arguments
are the key and value from that line.</p>
<p>If there are multiple <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TAB</span></tt> characters in a line, all <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TAB</span></tt>
characters after the first remain as part of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">value</span></tt> argument
of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mapper()</span></tt>.</p>
<p>If there are <em>no</em> <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TAB</span></tt> characters in a data line (as is the case
with all of our fish lines above), an empty string is created for
the value and the entire line&#8217;s content is treated as the key. This
is why the key is split in the mapper shown above.</p>
