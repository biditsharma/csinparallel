<h1>WebMapReduce Activities<a class="headerlink" href="#webmapreduce-activities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This document contains a series of activities for you to try with
WebMapReduce. Each one involves separate sets of data of increasing
size.</p>
<div class="section" id="poker-hands">
<h2>Poker Hands<a class="headerlink" href="#poker-hands" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first data set we will explore is about Poker Hands. The Poker
Hand Dataset contains a listing of 1,000,000 randomly generated, 5
card poker hands. Each line of the document contains a
comma-separated list of the information of each hand. If you read
it in order, each line describes first the suit, then the value of
each card. The final value on the line is the ranking of the hand.
So, each line reads, in abbreviated phrasing</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="sb">`S1,C1,S2,C2,S3,C3,S4,C4,S5,C4,R`</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The suits are translated as:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>1    Hearts
2    Spades
3    Diamonds
4    Clubs</pre>
</div>
<p>The rankings move in standard poker hand rank ordering:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>0    High Card
1    Pair
2    Two-Pair
3    Three of a kind
4    Straight (five cards of sequential rank with no gaps)
5    Flush (five cards of the same suit)
6    Full house (pair + three of a kind)
7    Four of a kind
8    Straight flush (straight of cards all in the same suit)
9    Royal flush (Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten, all of the same suit)</pre>
</div>
<p>So, a royal flush in hearts would look like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="sb">`1,1,1,13,1,12,1,11,1,10,9`</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The first thing we&#8217;ll do with this is count how many of the
1,000,000 hands are of each ranking. This will involve creating a
mapper that splits the inputted string into a list, and then emits
the ranking. Then the reducer will count how many times each
ranking is emitted. Remember, since this is a comma-separated list
and not a tab-separated list, each mapper will get the entire line
sent to it as the key, and the value sent to the mapper will be
blank. The data has already been uploaded and can be accessed from <strong>/shared/pokerHandData</strong>. Let&#8217;s start with the mapper, which should look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">mapper</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">hand</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">key</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;,&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">rank</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">hand</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="n">Wmr</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">emit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rank</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We emit a value of <img class="math" src="../_images/math/dce34f4dfb2406144304ad0d6106c5382ddd1446.png" alt="1"/> to make counting easier in the
reducer.</p>
<p>Next, we need our reducer. Remember that since we emitted the rank
as the key in the the mapper, each reducer will get a key equal to
a rank (0-9), and then an iterator of all of the values emitted by
the mappers. Since all of the values emitted by the mappers were
1&#8217;s, we can simply add up the 1&#8217;s to get our total count:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">reducer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">values</span><span class="p">):</span>

<h2>Car Information<a class="headerlink" href="#car-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Next, we&#8217;ll look at information on cars in another set of
comma-separated lists. Each car has six attributes: buying price,
maintenance price, number of doors, number of people who fit
inside, trunk size, safety, and acceptability of the car. The
possible values for each are:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Buying Price       v-high, high, med, low

<div class="section" id="movie-data">
<h2>Movie Data<a class="headerlink" href="#movie-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Next, we&#8217;re going to look at movie rating data. The information on
movie ratings was gathered by a University of Minnesota research
group called Movie Lens. The data set contains information on
10,000,054 different ratings, including 10,681 different movies and
71,567 different users (uploaded to <strong>/shared/MovieLens</strong>). Unlike the previous two datasets, this
dataset is arranged into tab-separated lists. Each line contains:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>MovieId    UserId   Rating   Timestamp</pre>
</div>
<p>Before we start playing with the data, let&#8217;s recall the differences
between using a tab-separated list and a comma-separated list. The
most obvious difference is using a different split. Instead of
splitting on <img class="math" src="../_images/math/1136b3a472e00b8eb20d289c6ed95c0293cc949e.png" alt="','"/>, we now need to split on
<img class="math" src="../_images/math/b8c2b025e116a2438f5754a9b020b805497332e0.png" alt="'\backslash t'"/>. The less obvious difference is how WMR
treats the lists. When using a tab-separated list, rather than
giving the whole line as the key to the mapper, it gives the first
value in the list as the key, and the rest as a single string for
the value. In the case of the movie ratings, this means that the
key of each mapper will be the MovieId. If it makes it easier for
you, you can change the def line of your mapper to read
<img class="math" src="../_images/math/141226fec15911798b64442b7e177814671cafeb.png" alt="def \ mapper(movieId, \ value)"/>.</p>
<p>To make this more clear, let&#8217;s look at a simple example. Let&#8217;s
count the total number of ratings each movie got. Examine the code
below:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">mapper</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">movieId</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">):</span>

<h2>Flight Data<a class="headerlink" href="#flight-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Provided by
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&amp;DB_Short_Name=On-Time">the Bureau of Transportation Statistics</a>,
the Flight Data dataset (the data is uploaded to <strong>/shared/FlightData</strong>) contains information on delayed and
cancelled flights. Each line of the data is arranged in a
comma-separated list detailing: Flight Date, Airline, Origin
Airport, Origin State, Destination Airport, Destination State,
Departure Delay, Arrival Delay, Cancellation Code, Carrier Delay,
Weather Delay, Security Delay, Late Aircraft Delay, Totally
Additional Gate Time.</p>
<p>A couple notes about the data. First, notice that a negative delay
means an early departure or arrival. Also, it is important to note
that all of the text entries in the data include quotes. Numbers
are represented in floating point without quotes. If you want to
include quotes in a string, you need to use a backlash. You can
also use the strip() method on any string to remove leading and
trailing characters. So if you <img class="math" src="../_images/math/5b89ace4ee504b4c3b15e04b01ab3554a1734d7d.png" alt="import \ string"/>, you can
do <img class="math" src="../_images/math/0e826c5ccdc08e8ae3e43520538e2ef6ff4ee5c8.png" alt="strip(string.punctuation)"/> to remove all punctuation,
including quotation marks, from the string. Next, be careful with
cancelled flights. Cancelled flights are represented differently in
the data than flights that were simply delayed, in that the delay
is left blank, but a code is put in the Cancellation Code column.
This means that somewhere in your mapper or reducer you have to
have a condition to deal with these, or else your values will not
come out well.</p>
<p>The data is organized into 4 folders. Each folder represents a
year&#8217;s worth of information. Thus, within <strong>/shared/FlightData</strong>, are directories for
data from 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008. Each file in those folders
contains a month&#8217;s worth of information. Each one of these has
files for each month of that year. So to get the January 2011 data,
your Cluster Path would be:</p>
<p><strong>/shared/FlightData/2011/201101.csv</strong>.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">that if you type
<strong>/shared/FlightData/2011</strong>
into the Cluster Data Path, you will use all of the files for the
year 2011 (the 2001 data is an incomplete set, in that it contains
data from January through April). Thus, you can do a year&#8217;s worth
of data at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">A nice trick when using WebMapReduce is that you can choose
the test option on one month&#8217;s worth of data and enter the identity
mapper and reducer to simply get a sense for what is in the first
few lines of the file itself. (Ask your instructor if you do not
have example Python files for an identity mapper and an identity
reducer.)</p>
</div>
<p><em>Do this now: use an identity mapper and identity reducer on this  file:</em></p>
<p>/shared/FlightData/2011/201101.csv</p>
<p>Note how the date is formatted: the date string is &#8220;year-month-day&#8221;
as &#8220;yyyy-mm-dd&#8221;. So a flight on January 1, 2011 has a date string
&#8220;2011-01-01&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>A potential issue:</strong> Now that we&#8217;ve mentioned the nice trick about
using test mode, it is sometimes tha case that test mode seems to
stop working in WMR. When this happens, you are left to simply
submit your work instead.</p>
<p>There is a &#8216;header&#8217; line in each file that indicates what is in
each &#8216;column&#8217; of data separated by the commas. It looks like this
(all on one line in the file):</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>"FL_DATE","CARRIER","ORIGIN","ORIGIN_STATE_ABR","DEST","DEST_STATE_ABR","DEP_DELAY","
ARR_DELAY","CANCELLATION_CODE","CARRIER_DELAY","WEATHER_DELAY","NAS_DELAY",
"SECURITY_DELAY","LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY","TOTAL_ADD_GTIME",</pre>
</div>
<p>To see just this line, you could use a mapper like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">mapper</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">items</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">key</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;,&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">items</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">==</span><span class="s">&#39;&quot;FL_DATE&quot;&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">Wmr</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">emit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then use an &#8216;identity reducer&#8217; with the above.</p>
<p>Now you have seen what is in this file. Before you can use this
data for analysis, you must first add a condition into your mapper
that deals with the first line of the file. If you examine the
files, you will see that the first line of each file is a header
file that details what information is on each line of the file.
This makes the file a lot easier to read, and is especially useful
if you are using the python csv module (which we will not use in
WebMapReduce). In our case however, you need to put a condition in
your mapper to ignore this line. Think about this: if you split the
key, what will the first element in the list be? Will it ever be
the same thing in any of the other lines as it is in the first
line?</p>

<div class="section" id="google-n-grams">
<h2>Google N-Grams<a class="headerlink" href="#google-n-grams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A N-Gram is a phrase of <img class="math" src="../_images/math/174fadd07fd54c9afe288e96558c92e0c1da733a.png" alt="n"/> words. For example, &#8220;hello&#8221; is
a 1-Gram, and &#8220;hello world&#8221; is a 2-Gram, or bi-gram. Using books
from Google Books, Google put together a list of N-Grams. Last
generated in July 2009, the corpora contains 10 Gigabytes(GB) of
1-Grams, 100 GB of 2-Grams, and 200 GB of 3-Grams. 4-Grams and
5-Grams are also available. The n-Grams data is uploaded to <strong>/shared/NGrams</strong></p>
<p>The N-Grams are arranged into files
which contain tab-separated lists. Each line shows the information
for an N-Gram for a given year. It gives the following information:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>N-Gram   Year   Total occurrences   Pages   Volumes</pre>
</div>
<p>The <img class="math" src="../_images/math/78b9c58bb4035cd1d20b7414138cbbf1716f057f.png" alt="Pages"/> entry is the total number of pages an N-Gram
occurs on. So if the word <strong>and</strong> appears 5 times on a page in a
book, it counts 5 times for the <img class="math" src="../_images/math/b8a679ae81467bfb6c2d1890c9ad5e2450b421c6.png" alt="Total \ occurences"/>, but
only once for the <img class="math" src="../_images/math/78b9c58bb4035cd1d20b7414138cbbf1716f057f.png" alt="Pages"/>. <img class="math" src="../_images/math/e66d2a7438a5dcd078f364f219152b2c2b2dd2fc.png" alt="Volumes"/> is the same
thing as <img class="math" src="../_images/math/78b9c58bb4035cd1d20b7414138cbbf1716f057f.png" alt="Pages"/>, except that it counts the number of
unique volumes or books that each N-Gram occurs in.</p>
<div class="section" id="grams">
<h3>1-Grams<a class="headerlink" href="#grams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s start by working with a useful 1-Grams activity. An
interesting problem you can investigate with N-Grams is how
language has developed over time. As language evolves, new words
enter peoples&#8217; vocabulary, while others fall into obscurity. I&#8217;m
sure you can think of many examples, like how <cite>thou</cite> has fallen
into obscurity, while the word <cite>computer</cite> is a relatively modern
word.</p>
<p>We will look at a useful method for determining high-frequency
interesting words. Our goal is to eliminate highly occurring words
of low interest, such as articles (the, a) and prepositions (e.g.
to, from, of for) and focus on &#8216;interesting&#8217; words that occur
often.</p>
<p>Information retrieval experts are interested in a related problem:
given a set of documents and a user&#8217;s query word, find all those
related to that particular word. This is done by locating the
documents where that word occurs the most often in relation to the
size of the document and number of total documents.</p>
<p>We can use this technique in a slightly different way to determine
the frequency of popular words, yet eliminate those that are simply
commonly occurring words in English. We will do this with a ratio
called a <cite>tf-idf</cite> (term frequency-inverse document frequency). The
formula for tf-idf is:</p>
<p><img class="math" src="../_images/math/e092b8583d055a80f4d323faeddb9572d1b5a34d.png" alt="log\left( \frac{number \ of \ documents \ that \ year}{number \ of \ documents \ the \ word \ appears \ in} \right) * Total \ occurrences"/></p>
<p>Notice how the fraction approaches one for uninteresting words that
occur in every document. Since the log of one is zero, this value
will be quite low. Those words that occur more frequently, but not
in every document, will have higher values. We will be examining
how to use this to determine some of the top frequently occurring
words per year in the 1-grams dataset.</p>
<p>There are some Python files to help you get started in a directory
of files on moodle.</p>
<p>The file called <cite>1gramMap.py</cite> in this directory contains a
dictionary called <cite>yearDict</cite> that has defined the total number of
unique 1-Grams for each year. We did some separate analysis of the
1-grams to devise this dictionary for you. What is this mapper
emitting? Note that we are eliminating years where there is not
very much data (low number of volumes), because the tf-idf
calculation is less useful for these.</p>
<p>Now let us examine the reducer, in a file called <cite>1gramReduce.py</cite>.
Look it over and explain what it is doing. Write explanations as
comments in each of these files.</p>
<p>There are likely a few new things in this code that you have not
seen before. OIne of them is the use of the <cite>sorted</cite> method to sort
the items in a dictionary. Try to look up how this works. We need
to sort the words out into a list of pairs (word, frequency),
ordered by frequency, in order to emit only the top 20 frequently
occurring words. If you still find this confusing, try creating a
simple example and using it in a script. Create a dictionary that
is not sorted, sort it, and then loop through it getting the sorted
values.</p>
<div class="section" id="activity">
<h4>Activity<a class="headerlink" href="#activity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Run this code through the 1-gram data, found on <strong>/shared/NGrams/1-Grams</strong>. Do
you find anything interesting in any particular year?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id4">
<h4>Activity<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Now you will do something different. Your goal: pick some words and
see how their frequencies have changed over time. You can do this
one word at a time. Your final output will be the pairs of (year,
frequency of that word in that year).</p>
<p>In your mapper, you will want to ignore all words in the files,
except for the word you are looking for. By doing this, we are
using the many mappers that will each work on one line of this data
as &#8216;filters&#8217; to eliminate all words but the one we are interested
in. In this case the year will be the key. You decide</p>
<p>Each reducer will work on a year. In your reducer, you can use a
dictionary of the total number of words per year in the collection.
We have created this for you in the file <a class="reference download internal" href="../_downloads/findWordReduce.py"><tt class="xref download docutils literal"><span class="pre">findWordReduce.py</span></tt></a>.
Figure out how this will help you generate the frequency of the
word in that year.</p>

<h2>Google Fusion Tables<a class="headerlink" href="#google-fusion-tables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this section, we will explore using the Google Labs project
Google Fusion Tables. Google Fusion Tables allows you to import
tables of data, merge them together, and then create
visualizations. If you follow the below steps, you should be able
to get started very easily.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">First, you need a Google account. It appears that this will not
work with your Macalester Google Apps account. You will need to use
it with another gmail address ending in &#64;gmail.com. If you don&#8217;t
have one, you could create a Google account. They are free and easy
to set up.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Go to the bar at the top of any google page which lists the
different Google Services. The last item should read <cite>more</cite>. Click
on it, then click on <cite>even more</cite> at the bottom of the dropdown
menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Scroll to the bottom of the page. Under the last heading,
<img class="math" src="../_images/math/9694980fd65799cef3903f47f361fd99bfa53073.png" alt="Innovation"/>, you should see a link to Google Fusion
Tables. Click on it.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">From the main page, you can see a list of all the tables you
have created/imported (using a gmail address).</p>
<p>If you see a list of all of your files from your Macalester Google
Apps account, this means you are logged into that, and will need to
log out. Or you can use a different browser and log into your gmail
account with that.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Whe logged into your Gmail account: You can view your Google
Docs available with that account by choosing &#8216;View My Tables&#8217;. Here
is Google&#8217;s help page for importing your files for use with Fusion
Tables:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/support/fusiontables/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=181717">Google Fusion Table Help to Import Files</a></p>
<p>You will be importing your files into Google Docs as &#8216;Tables&#8217;. Be
sure to choose that your file is tab-separated if it came from
WMR.</p>
<p>(See example files below if you don&#8217;t have one of your own too
try.)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">To create a graph of your data table now in Google Docs, simply
select <img class="math" src="../_images/math/1147fb5b4b04eb180249a16e9da2f1c783bf4a10.png" alt="Visualize"/> from the top menu of your table. Then,
select the type of visualization you would like to use.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Play around with the different features of the visualizations to
get a feel of how to create graphs.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="merging-tables">
<h2>Merging Tables<a class="headerlink" href="#merging-tables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are two files that you can try using for this available on
moodle:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>ComputerOccurences.csv</li>
<li>technologyOccurences.csv</li>
</ol>
<p>Though the names imply that they are comma-separated, the data in
each column is actually tab-separated.</p>
<p>Some of the activities you will do will require you to merge output
from a couple of WMR job outputs like these together and visualize
them together. Doing this is quite simple:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Open one of the files you would like to merge from the Google
Fusion Talbes main page.</li>
<li>Select <img class="math" src="../_images/math/f11706a45c3dfd8d181db1ae680c45ecdf210f8d.png" alt="Merge"/> from the top menu of the table.</li>
<li>Click in the input box next to the big number 2. This should
open a drop-down list of your other tables. Select the one you
would like to merge to your table.</li>
<li>In the two side-by-side boxes below this, click on the
radio-button (it looks like a grey dot) next to the value that is
shared between both tables. This should be something like year, or
month, or whatever the common variable is between the two tables.</li>
<li>Below both boxes, check the <img class="math" src="../_images/math/66e355112ab188efd474a2f94b7af64791bd39c4.png" alt="Select\ columns"/> option.
Then, make sure that all of the square boxes are checked next to
your variables.</li>
<li>Enter a name for the new table you are making in the text box
where it asks you to.</li>
<li>Click <img class="math" src="../_images/math/71148c578c4ebaf25682198793ba3cb28105adec.png" alt="Merge\ tables"/></li>
<li>You can then visualize the new table just like any other table.
To select to show all values, either hold the CTRL or SHIFT button
on your keyboard as you select the columns in the list.</li>
</ol>
