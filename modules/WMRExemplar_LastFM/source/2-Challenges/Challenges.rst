Challenge Problems
##################

Now that you're familiar with the dataset try some of these
challenge problems. Be careful, some songs are missing fields

- Find the average artist familiarity. This information is stored
  in the metadata file at index 6 so you'll have to find a way
  to make sure that each artist is only counted once

- Find the average danceablity of an artist's songs. Compare it
  with the artist's familiarity. Is there a correlation between 
  them?

- Find the duration of the fade in/out for each song. Plot your
  results by year. How have tastes changed over time?

- Do similar artists have similar danceabilities, energies, and
  loudnesses?
