* The :math:`\pi`-calculus is an example of a *process calculus*, i.e., a mathematical structure with a set of values and operations on those values in which processes are among the values and parallel composition ("running processes in parallel") is a commutative and associative operation on processes.

* The :math:`\pi`-calculus was created in 1992 by Robin Milner, Joachim Parrow, and David Walker. Milner (1934-2010) was a famous British computer scientist known for inventing one of the early systems for automatic theorem proving (LCF) and for creating the functional programming language ML, in addition to the :math:`\pi`-calculus.

* The :math:`\pi`-calculus extends Milner's earlier process calculus system called CCS (Calculus of Concurrent Systems) [Milner 80].

* Another famous British computer scientist, Tony Hoare, created a simlar system called CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) [Hoare 85], starting about 1978. CSP is the theoretical basis for the Occam language for parallel programming.

* A major distinction between the :math:`\pi`-calculus and predecessor systems is the :math:`\pi`-calculus's ability to pass a channels from one process to another, along some other communication channel. This feature enables the system to model mobility, (e.g., cell phones) and changes in process structure.
