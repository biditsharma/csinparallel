Optimizing CUDA for GPU Architecture
====================================

nVIDIA GPU cards use an advanced arcitecture to efficiently execute
massively parallel programs written in CUDA C. This module explains how to take
advantage of this architecture to provide maximum speedup for
your CUDA applications using a mandelbrot set generator as an 
example. It is intended to be a resource for instructors wishing
to create lectures, though it can also be presented to students 
as is.

Feel free to use and modify the code and images in this module
in your lectures.
