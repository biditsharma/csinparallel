<p>CPUs are designed to process as many sequential instructions as
quickly as possible. While most CPUs support threading, creating
a thread is usually an expensive operation and high-end CPUs can
usually make efficient use of no more than about 12 concurrent threads.</p>
<p>GPUs on the other hand are designed to process a small number of
parallel instructions on large sets of data as quickly as
possible. For instance, calculating 1 million polygons and
determining which to draw on the screen and where. To do this they
rely on many slower processors and inexpensive threads.</p>
<div class="section" id="physical-architecture">
<h2>Physical Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#physical-architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>CUDA-capable GPU cards are composed of one or more <strong>Streaming Multiprocessors</strong>
(SMs), which are an abstraction of the underlying hardware.
Each SM has a set of <strong>Streaming Processors</strong> (SPs), also called CUDA cores, which share a cache of shared memory
that is faster than the GPU&#8217;s global memory but that can only be accessed by the threads
running on the SPs the that SM.  These streaming processors are the &#8220;cores&#8221; that
execute instructions.</p>
<p>The numbers of SPs/cores in an SM and the number of SMs depend on your device: see the <em>Finding your
Device Specifications</em> section below for details. It is important to realize, however, that
regardless of GPU model, there are many more CUDA cores in a GPU than in a typical multicore CPU:
hundreds or thousands more. For example, the Kepler Streaming Multiprocessor design, dubbed SMX, contains 192
single-precision CUDA cores, 64 double-precision units, 32 special function units, and 32 load/store units.
(See the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nvidia.com/content/PDF/kepler/NVIDIA-Kepler-GK110-Architecture-Whitepaper.pdf">Kepler Architecture Whitepaper</a>
for a description and diagram.)</p>
<p>CUDA cores are grouped together to perform instructions in
a what nVIDIA has termed a <strong>warp</strong> of threads. Warp simply means a group of threads
that are scheduled together to execute the same instructions in lockstep.
All CUDA cards to date use a warp size of 32.
Each SM has at least one warp scheduler, which is responsible for executing 32 threads.
Depending on the model of GPU, the cores may be
double or quadruple pumped so that they execute one instruction
on two or four threads in as many clock cycles.
For instance, Tesla devices use a group of 8 quadpumped cores
to execute a single warp. If there are less than 32 threads scheduled in
the warp, it will still take as long to execute the instructions.</p>
<p>The CUDA programmer is responsible for ensuring that the threads are being assigned
efficiently for code that is designed to run on the GPU.  The assignment of threads
is done virtually in the code using what is sometimes referred to as a &#8216;tiling&#8217; scheme
of blocks of threads that form a grid.  Programmers define a <strong>kernel function</strong>
that will be executed on the CUDA card using a particular tiling scheme.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="virtual-architecture">
<h2>Virtual Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#virtual-architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When programming in CUDA C we work with blocks of threads and
grids of blocks. What is the relationship between this virtual
architecture and the CUDA card&#8217;s physical architecture?</p>
<p>When kernels are launched, each block in a grid is assigned to a
Streaming Multiprocessor. This allows threads in a block to use
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__shared__</span></tt> memory. If a block doesn&#8217;t use the full resources
of the SM then multiple blocks may be assigned at once. If all of
the SMs are busy then the extra blocks will have to wait until a
SM becomes free.</p>
<p>Once a block is assigned to an SM, it&#8217;s threads are split into
warps by the warp scheduler and executed on the CUDA cores.
Since the same instructions are executed on each thread in the
warp simultaneously it&#8217;s generally a bad idea to have
conditionals in kernel code.  This type of code is sometimes called <em>divergent</em>:
when some threads in a warp are unable to execute the same instruction
as other threads in a warp, those threads are diverged and do no work.</p>
<p>Because a warp&#8217;s context (it&#8217;s registers, program counter etc.)
stays on chip for the life of the warp, there is no additional
cost to switching between warps vs executing the next step of a
given warp. This allows the GPU to switch to hide some of it&#8217;s
memory latency by switching to a new warp while it waits for a
costly read.</p>

<h2>CUDA Memory<a class="headerlink" href="#cuda-memory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>CUDA on chip memory is divided into several different regions</p>
<ul>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>Registers</strong> act the same way that registers on CPUs do, each</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">thread has it&#8217;s own set of registers.</p>

</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>Local Memory</strong> local variables used by each thread. They are</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">not accesible by other threads even though they use the same
L1 and L2 cache as global memory.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>Shared Memory</strong> is accessible by all threads in a block. It</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">must be declared using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__shared__</span></tt> modifier. It has a
higher bandwidth and lower latency than global memory. However, if
multiple threads request the same address, the requests are
processed serially, which slows down the application.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>Constant Memory</strong> is read-accessible by all theads and must</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">be declared with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__const__</span></tt> modifier. In newer devices
there is a seperate read only constant cache.</p>

</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>Global Memory</strong> is accessible by all threads. It&#8217;s the</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">slowest device memory, but on new cards, it is cached. Memory
is pulled in 32, 64, or 128 byte memory transactions. Warps
executing global memory accesses attempt to pull all the data
from global memory simultaneously therefore it&#8217;s advantageous
to use block sizes that are multiples of 32. If
multidimensional arrays are used, it&#8217;s also advantageous to
have the bounds padded so that they are multiples of 32</p>

<h2>Finding your Device Specifications<a class="headerlink" href="#finding-your-device-specifications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>nVIDIA provides a program with the installation of the CUDA developer toolkit
that prints out the specifications of
your device. To run it on a unix machine, execute this command:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/usr/local/cuda/samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery/deviceQuery</span></tt></p>
<p>If that doesn&#8217;t work you probably need to build the samples</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">cd</span> /usr/local/cuda/samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery
sudo make
./deviceQuery
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Look for the number of Multiprocessors on your device,
the number of CUDA cores per SM, and the warp size.</p>
<p>The CUDA Toolkit with the samples is also available for Windows using Visual studio.
See the excellent and thorough <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-getting-started-guide-for-microsoft-windows/#axzz3ACR56e2v">Getting Started Guide for Windows</a>
provided by nVIDIA for more information.  However, some of the code described in the
next section uses X11 calls for its graphical display, which will not easily run in Windows.
You will need a package like Cygwin/X.</p>
