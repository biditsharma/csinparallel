How to compile and run:

make takes the following options [OPTION]:
(no option)				- ideal for running the serial or the chunks version
OMP_CHUNKS_OF_ONE=1 	- enables chunks of one domain decomposition in the OpenMP environment. If
						  ran with MPI, the processes will do chunks only
MPI_CHUNKS_OF_ONE=1		- enables chunks of one domain decomposition in the MPI environment *only*
H_CHUNKS_OF_ONE=1		- enables chunks of one domain decomposition for both MPI and OpenMP
						  environment
NO_X11=1				- disables X windows. It is recommended that the do-display option be also disabled
						  when running the program

COMPILE:
for serial: 
  make area.c-serial [OPTION]
for openmp: 
  make area.c-openmp [OPTION]
for mpi: 
  make area.c-mpi [OPTION]
for openmp and mpi: 
  make area.c-mpi-openmp [OPTION]
for all: 
  make all [OPTION]


RUN:
for serial:	./area.c-serial
for openmp: 	./area.c-openmp
for mpi: 	mpirun -np [n] ./area.c-mpi
for mpi-openmp: mpirun -np [n] ./area.c-mpi-openmp

all runs take the following options:
-n = number of rectangles
-l = left x boundary of the domain
-r = right x boundary of the domain
-x = 'display' or 'no-display' (without the quotation marks, default is display)
-w = 'gap' or 'no-gap' (without the quotation marks, default is gap)
-t = throttle time in microseconds
-T = set number of threads when using OpenMP

SAMPLE COMPILE/RUNS

1.

make all
mpirun -np 3 ./area.c-mpi -n 30

2.
make area.c-mpi-openmp H_CHUNKS_OF_ONE=1
mpirun -np 3 ./area.c-mpi-openmp -n 30 -T 4 -t 100
